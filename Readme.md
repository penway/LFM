# Latent Feature Maximization

The is the implementation of the paper: [Latent Space is Feature Space: Regularization Term for GANs Training on Limited Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16251), and the original lab environment.

The useful implementation are in the `src` folder, where I have implemented *DCGAN* and *DCGAN with LFM*. The `lab.py` is to loop over configurations for generating results of comparison tests.

If you have any question about the LFM or the result, feel free to contact me. LFM did not show great result on CelebA when the dataset size went over 20k images.
